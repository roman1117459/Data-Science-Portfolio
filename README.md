# Data Science Portfolio
Thi repository is containing portfolio of data science projects completed by me for self learning, academic and hobby purposes. Presented in the form of iPython Notebooks, and R markdown files (published at RPubs).

## Contents

- ### Machine Learning

	- [Predicting Boston Housing Prices](https://github.com/roman1117459/my_Data_Science_Portfolio/tree/master/Boston_Housing_price_Prediction_END_to_END): A model to predict the value of a given house in the Boston real estate market using various statistical analysis tools. Identified the best price that a client can sell their house utilizing machine learning.
	- [Predicting Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster](https://github.com/roman1117459/my_Data_Science_Portfolio/tree/master/Titanic_Dataset_Kaggle): 

	

	_Tools: scikit-learn, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib,Numpy


- ### Data Analysis and Visualisation
	- __Python__
		- [Titanic Dataset - Exploratory Analysis](https://github.com/roman1117459/my_Data_Science_Portfolio/tree/master/Titanic_Dataset_Kaggle): Exploratory Analysis of the passengers onboard RMS Titanic using Pandas and Seaborn visualisations.
		
	_Tools: Pandas, Folium, Seaborn and Matplotlib_

	- __R__ 
		- [Dataset analysis&fit_neuralmodel](https://github.com/roman1117459/my_Data_Science_Portfolio/tree/master/R%20project): This is a academic purpose project where I have learned data analysis and visualisation using R. It is a very important tool for a data scientist or ml engineer. Because using R, the analysis and visualising part is easy. I have implement some visualisation, Data Cleaning, and fit a model in this project. 
		
	

- ### End To End Projects: 

	- __Python__
		- [ML with Linear Regression](https://github.com/sajal2692/data-science-portfolio/blob/master/ML%20Micro%20Projects/Machine%20Learning%20with%20Logistic%20Regression.ipynb): Using Linear Regression to predict the estimate price of a house using its location, number of bedroom and bathroom. This project is completed by using python framework flask. The model have a very good accuracy and this is a datascience end to end project. Where I have completed data collection, Data cleaning, feature engineering, data visualisation, fitting model and finally the part of deployment successfully.  
		


Public.

I also dabble in all other kinds of technology. You can find a general portfolio [here](https://github.com/roman1117459).
